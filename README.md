# goldeneye
Goldeneye is a browser extension for Google Chrome that makes it easy to look up 4-letter alpha codes (aka "banding codes") as decided by the Institute of Bird Populations and the Bird Banding Laboratory.

The extension currently supports full species name searches, as well as 4-letter code searches. 

Actual app files are contained in `package/`. Other files contain the .CSV files of IBP and BBL alpha codes, plus the R program used to create a javascript dictionary for these codes.
