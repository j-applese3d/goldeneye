# goldeneye
Goldeneye is a browser extension for Google Chrome that makes it easy to look up 4-letter alpha codes (aka "banding codes") as decided by the Institute of Bird Populations (IBP). It can be downloaded for free at the [Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goldeneye-alpha-code-dict/jgpgcliniicmfeinkdefigmmnjhfadmm/reviews).

The extension currently supports full species name searches, as well as 4-letter code searches. 

Actual app files are contained in `package/`. Other files contain the .CSV files of IBP and BBL alpha codes, plus the R program used to create a JS dictionary for these codes.
